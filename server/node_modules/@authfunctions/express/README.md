# @authfunctions/express

This package is used to handle the User-authentication/-authorization with the popular web-framework express. It uses a secure two token based authorization system via jwt (jsonwebtokens) in combination with pre-integrated password and email validations. All database related actions are **not** implemented, so you can choose your database-system freely.
